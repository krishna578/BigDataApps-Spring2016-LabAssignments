The Algorithm is implemented by using Mapper and Reducer
Let us assume input file as key value pairs as (Person, Friends)

Mapper
The Mapper class takes above input and emits this Key Value Pair (Person1Person2, Friends of Person1+Friends of Person2)

Reducer
The Reducer takes above input and and converts the Key value Pair which is Output of our program (Person1,Person2, Common Friends)
